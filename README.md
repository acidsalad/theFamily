# theFamily
A newbie's C++ game, in which the player has a really, REALLY bad relationship with his/her family.

All but the diceRoll.cpp file are relevant to this project.
      # - this is some comic relief that will actually be implemented in the project later.
I am a mathematician learning to code with object-oriented programming.
In this game, you must fight your family and escape the earth. It's simple, but a good place to stary.
#The problems at the time of this post (can be found under the errorBranch branch) are:
  1: player.cpp file crashes whenever I try to overwrite private variables with a private function.
      - although this could be the main.cpp crashing after the function call.
#2: RE-FIXED. Again. In order to make sure this stays fixed, I'm keeping in the length checks until further notice.

All enemyies inherit from the Enemy class  (enemy.h).
